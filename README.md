To reproduce the examples, an analysis container is used to recreat the software environment where the code is ran. 
The docker image [mahshaaban/phyloana](https://cloud.docker.com/u/mahshaaban/repository/docker/mahshaaban/phyloana)  is used for this purpose.

The docker image can be obtained and initialized as follows:

```bash
docker pull mahshaaban/phyloana:latest
docker run -it mahshaaban/phyloana bash
```

## The data and source code

This repo also contains data neccessary for reproducing examples in `data/`. The output of the examples is also tracked in `output/`.
To obtain a local copy of the repo use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahShaaban/phyloana
